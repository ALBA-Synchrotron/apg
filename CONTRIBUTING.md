# CONTRIBUTING:

If you find any mistake in this guide or think can improve it somehow, 
the easiest way to contribute is by [directly editting it online](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html).

Do not worry, if you do not have write access, GitLab will automatically create 
a personal fork and submit a Merge Request, so we can review your changes before 
integrating them).

Of course you can also [do a Merge Request manually](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html)

Also, check the list of [open known issues](https://git.cells.es/ctpkg/documentation/issues)
