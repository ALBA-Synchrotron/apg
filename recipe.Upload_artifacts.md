# Upload artifacts to ALBA repo:

The results from the build will be created in `../build-area` (e.g., assuming 
that your local packaging repo was in `/packaging/foo_deb`, 
the results will be in `/packaging/build-area/`).

In order to make the created packages available to other ALBA machines, you need
to upload the package build results to any of the ALBA 
repositories:
* [deb9_production](http://controls01.cells.es/testrepo/debian9/) (this is the 
  repo that will be normally used in production machines)
* [deb9_staging]((http://controls01.cells.es/testrepo/debian9_staging/)) (this 
  repo is used for pre-production testing and for automatically -CI- created 
  packages that have not yet being tested by a human)

The easiest is to use the `upload <repo_name>` command in your local packaging 
repo (if everything is ok, 
it will ask you for **siciliaâ€™s passwd**).

The `upload` needs a repository name (If you don't give any argument it will 
show you the help):
```
Usage: give a valid repo
e.g. upload deb9_staging"
e.g. upload deb9_production"
```
The `upload` command executes a `lintian` check (if there is any lintian error 
the upload will be aborted). If the check is passed, it executes the `dput` 
command for the given repository. Finally, the `upload` command will trigger 
an update the ALBA repositories.
