# Test the new package installation

Congratulations! You are done with the new package!

It is always a good idea to test that your package can be correctly installed.

This can be done with the following command:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install <YOUR_PACKAGE>
```

In the [Tips and Tricks](Appendix_6.md) appendix, you can find, among others, 
interesting suggestions for the purpose of checking if your package can be 
correctly installed, and that the package files will be installed at the correct 
locations.
